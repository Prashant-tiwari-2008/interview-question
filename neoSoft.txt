Instructions:
You need to write code for the questions listed below. You can attempt any two out of five questions. You can use any online compiler, system editor or web console.
You have a total 30 min time. Your code should run and output should match.
At the end you need to show output by running it.

If you don’t have any editor then you can also use following,

Find the next palindrome number. If I pass any integer value to function it should return the next palindrome number.
For example:
If I pass 105 - it should return 111
If I pass 100 - it should return 101
Print the first “n” prime numbers. N is anything a user might enter.
For example:
n = 5 Output is 2,3,5,7,11
n = 8 Output is 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19
Write a function fib() that takes an integer n and returns the series up to nth Fibonacci number.
	
	For example: 

fib(1);  // => 1
fib(2);  // => 1, 1
fib(3);  // => 1, 1, 2
fib(4);  // => 1, 1, 2, 3
fib(5);  // => 1, 1, 2, 3, 5
fib(6);  // => 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
Create an Angular / React component which will have a progress bar. It will increment after 1 secs. The progress bar will keep on incrementing till the width of the page is met and then it will stop incrementing.

Write an algorithm which will tell if a group of characters can be a probable palindrome string with its different combination. Example “rarecac”…. Its possible combinations can be rraacec, racecar etc. Now Racecar is the palindrome, hence return true
