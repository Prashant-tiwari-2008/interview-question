// Given two integers N and M, where N is the number of friends sitting in a clockwise manner in a circle and M is the number of cakes. The task is to calculate the left number of cakes after distributing i cakes to iâ€™th friend. The distribution of cakes will stop if the count of cakes is less than the required amount.
